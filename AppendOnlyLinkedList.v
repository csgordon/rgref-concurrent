(** * A "Postpend"-only Linked List
    We side-step the induction-recursion issues we hit in the prepend-only
    example by doing append-only via set-once options.  This makes it
    much easier to prove things about manipulating the list.  The downside
    is that we can't prevent cycles - doing so would need to talk about
    reachability through cons cells in the definition of the list type,
    forcing induction-recursion again.
